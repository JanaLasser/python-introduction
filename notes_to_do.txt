changes (to do):

order:
    * append dictionaries to 02-lists
        (done)
    * split lesson 6 in two:
        6a: standard libraries (minus OS)
        6b: OS and file IO
        (maybe keep OS in 6a?)
    * ordering of 6b, 7, 8 is nice and logical: first IO, then compute, then plot
    * maybe bigger exercise? like compute/plot histogram of letter freqs.
    * add lesson 9-misc -> just mention prompts, exceptions, other ways of running
        maybe also more difficult exercise?
        in general: be present so students can finish old exercises

I/O (file formats - hdf5?) - see standard libraries (there is some done on it already)
    * find entry in phonebook - basic IO and/or CSV?
    * similar stuff in lesson 6.
    * show basic IO, mention that ease-of-use libraries wrap this (CSV, HDF5, CDF, ...)
    * no HDF5 etc., too difficult
    * numpy load/save?

dictionaries
    * we should add this...
    * reuse phonebook example?

other ways of using python (not only jupyter)
(mainly mentioning this is possible)
    * script from terminal in Jupyter
    * ipython
    * IDE

prompts
    * merge with basic IO if it is easy enough

exceptions
    * low prio: throw Exception("your input was wrong") as means of simple feedback

plotting (enlarge section?)
    * no change

before course:
send reminder email (including: room, time, GWDG account, maybe try to use login?)
check the wifi access point in the room
check if presenter & other equipment works
